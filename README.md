# itc-172-VenueLoginRegisterClient
adds login functionality

We will build a client application for the registration service.
It will include validation of the text fields in the registration.
When the venue logs in it should store their key as a session variable and then redirect them to a page where they can add a new show. (for now all you need is a heading on the page that says "Add show."
set up and complete test document
